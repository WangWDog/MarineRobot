# Introduction
This program runs on the STM32H407 and controls a
7-motor marine robot capable of moving in six degrees of freedom: X, Y, Z, roll, pitch, and yaw. To enable dynamic response to motion commands, we introduced FreeRTOS and state machine theory, which helped decouple the system architecture, making the project modular, easy to program, and well-structured.
